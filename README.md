Hi, I’m Cedric. I'm an IT manager struggling to find my way back to what I love to do... solving problem through programming. I’m interested in everything that is tech from the latest raspberry pi board to advances in quantum computing. I'm not an expert in any tech but rather an avid spectator to human ingenuity. I’m previously a mainframe programmer and now I'm trying to learn anything that I can get my hands on. My latest pursuit is Python and its countless practical applications.
