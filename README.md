Hello, my name is Cedric. As an IT manager, I'm rediscovering my passion for problem-solving through programming. My interests encompass the entire spectrum of technology, ranging from the newest Raspberry Pi boards to the cutting-edge advancements in quantum computing. While I may not be an expert in any specific field, I am a keen observer of human innovation. My background includes COBOL programming, and I am currently broadening my skill set by exploring a variety of technologies, with a particular focus on Python and its myriad of practical uses.
