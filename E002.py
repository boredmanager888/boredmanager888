# What have i learned from this challenge?                    *
#     Do we enclosed a variable to be displayed with '+'? I   *
# can't find the purpose of the sign in the line of code and  *
# I can't recall if I ever found that out previously (A0).    *
#                                                             *

#     What i found out about the '+' sign is that it helps in *
# the concatenation of values not sure if that includes all   *
# types of value but I think it is just for strings.          *
