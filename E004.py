# what have I learned from this challenge?                    
# - the python is displaying up to 9 decimal places. Is that
#   the limit before using exponential form? (A1)
# - the program is a copy of the previous exercise except the
#   the addition of the conversion from sq. feet to acre.
# - still need to brush up with the use of different operation 
#   and its effect in different scenarios. (A2)
# - will it change to exponential form if the 4th decimal place
#   is zero? (A3)
# - [040221] added a process of rounding the number to 6 decimal
#   places. however it does not prevent it from formating it to 
#   exponential form if the decimal value is too small. can this
#   be prevented? (A4)
