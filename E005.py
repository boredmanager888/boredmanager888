# In many jurisdictions a small deposit is added to drink     *
# containers to encourage people to recycle them. In one      *
# particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter *
# or less have a $0.10 deposit, and drink containers holding  *
# more than one liter have a $0.25 deposit.                   *
# Write a program that reads the number of containers of each *
# size from the user. Your program should continue by         *
# computing and displaying the refund that will be received   *
# for returning those containers. Format the output so that   *
# it includes a dollar sign and always displays exactly two   *
# decimal places.                                             *

#**************************************************************
# what have I learned from this challenge?
# - adding the round function will ensure that it will always 
#   have a 2 decimal places regardless if other checks are 
#   already in place.
# - it will now check every input for invalid date unlike the 
#   previous apps.
# - the round functions lets you round to the nearest decimal
#   depending on the parameter. if you did not indicate a place 
#   value it will just truncate it to the interger but sill 
#   leaves out the decimal point, why? (A1)
