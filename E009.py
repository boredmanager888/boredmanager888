# Pretend that you have just opened a new savings account     * 
# that earns 4 percent interest per year. The interest that   * 
# you earn is paid at the end of the year, and is added to    * 
# the balance of the savings account. Write a program that    * 
# begins by reading the amount of money deposited into the    * 
# account from the user. Then your program should compute and * 
# display the amount in the savings account after 1, 2, and 3 *
# years. Display each amount so that it is rounded to 2       *
# decimal places.                                             *

# what have I learned from this challenge?
# - the challenge is another variation of the previous exercise.
# - i guess the aim here is to ensure that the programmer know
#   how to handle different kinds of computations.
