# Tax and Tip                                                 *
# Programmer: BoredManager                                    *
# The program that you create for this exercise will begin by * 
# reading the cost of a meal ordered at a restaurant from the * 
# user. Then your program will compute the tax and tip for    * 
# the meal. Use your local tax rate when computing the amount * 
# of tax owing. Compute the tip as 18 percent of the meal     * 
# amount (without the tax). The output from your program      * 
# should include the tax amount, the tip amount, and the      * 
# grand total for the meal including both the tax and the     * 
# tip. Format the output so that all of the values are        * 
# displayed using two decimal places.                         *

# what have I learned from this challenge?
# - it gets easier because the next challenge is usually a 
#   variation of the previous one.
# - i still need to brush up with the variable definition and 
#   available operation in Python (A1).
